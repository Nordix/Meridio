# note: To run as non-root user, cap_dac_override file capability might be required in case hostPath
# volumes are used where the mounted contents file permissions do not allow "others" the required
# access modes (or permissions weren't adjusted by some other means).
# For example, hostPath unix spire-agent-socket's file permissions grant "write" access for "others", thus
# cap_dac_override is not needed by the nsp binary.
# Similarly in development environments (e.g. Kind, xcluster) in case of Rancher's Local Path based
# persistent storage the mounted directory's file permissions will allow 'rwx' access for "others".
# Yet, if the persistent storage file already exists when for example upgrading from a root user
# deployment (or simply the user id changes), access problems might arise in case of hostPath based
# persistent storage solutions. Otherwise e.g. "fsGroup" should secure access through group ownership.
