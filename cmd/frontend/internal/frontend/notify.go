// Notify Meridio whether the particular frontend has external connectivity or not.
// Currently only LB-FE composite is supported. Therefore LBs are only interested in events
// related to the collocated FE (residing in the same POD).
//
// Hostname information is used to determine collocation, thus there's no need to announce IPs
// as of now. However NSP requires "IP information" for item comparision, but hostnames do fine
// as well (NSP won't check if it's a real IP).
//
// Note: Currently IPv4/IPv6 connectivity is not separated, as IPv4/IPv6 handling is not properly
// separated in Meridio when managing the NSM backplane either.

// TODO: add context to nspClient calls so that they could be cancelled
// TODO: must denounce FE upon its shutdown (make sure it won't block forever e.g. in case NSP is no longer available)
// TODO: NSP must be improved to somehow learn if source of a Register event has disappeared (check NSM registry for clue)
// (maybe introduce timed Register that requires registration)
// TODO: maybe introduce update target through new context keyword, indicating nsp to replace found item with new one
