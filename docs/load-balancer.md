# Load-balancer

* [cmd](https://github.com/Nordix/Meridio/tree/master/cmd/load-balancer)
* [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Nordix/Meridio/tree/master/build/load-balancer)

## Description

The load balancer is using a user space [Maglev](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44824.pdf) implementation to load balance traffic among multiple targets.

At Start, the load balancer is subscribing to events from the NSP Service to get notifications about target registration / unregistration in order to update the identifiers in the [nfqueue-loadbalancer program](https://github.com/Nordix/nfqueue-loadbalancer), the IP rules and the IP routes.

Since the [nfqueue-loadbalancer program](https://github.com/Nordix/nfqueue-loadbalancer) is running in user space, iptables together with nfqueue are used to bring traffic from kernel space to user space. The [nfqueue-loadbalancer program](https://github.com/Nordix/nfqueue-loadbalancer) will then add a forwarding mark on the traffic based on [Maglev](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44824.pdf) and according to the registered target identifiers, and will return the traffic to the kernel space. Using the forwarding mark, IP rules and IP routes, the traffic will be forwarded to the selected target.

NET_ADMIN | The load balancer configures IP rules and IP routes to steer packets (processed by [nfqueue-loadbalancer program](https://github.com/Nordix/nfqueue-loadbalancer)) to targets. The user space load balancer program relies on [libnetfilter_queue](https://netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue).
DAC_OVERRIDE | The load balancer requires access to a unix socket provided by a hostPath volume to interact with NSM.
IPC_LOCK | The user space load balancer program uses shared memory.
IPC_OWNER | The user space load balancer program uses shared memory.
