# Proxy

* [cmd](https://github.com/Nordix/Meridio/tree/master/cmd/proxy)
* [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Nordix/Meridio/tree/master/build/proxy)

## Description

The proxy allows targets (e.g. TCP application) to be connected to multiple network service instances (e.g. load-balancer) via a single network interface.

To create the full mesh between the proxy and the network service instances, the proxy uses the NSM API to monitor the NSEs, and requests the connection to each of them. For the targets, the proxy acts as a network service with the same network service name + proxy as prefix: `proxy.<conduit-name>.<trench-name>.<namespace>`.

When started, the proxy requests a subnet from the IPAM Service, so each proxy instance will own a unique subnet and will allocate IPs of targets and Network service instances based on it. Since each proxy has a unique subnet, the network service instances will easily find the correct path to the target via the default routes.

From the network service instances side, the proxy acts as a bridge, so the network service instances can access each individual target via their IPs. From the target side, the proxy acts as a router/gateway, the outgoing traffic of the target. Since it acts as a router/gateway, the proxy is creation source based routes to distribute the outgoing traffic among the network service instances.

Note: Currently the proxy support only 1 conduit.
