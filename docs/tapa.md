## Description

The Target Access Point Ambassador (TAPA) is the main interface user applications can use to interact with Meridio. The TAPA is a local service running in the user pod as a side-car container. User applications can connect to the TAPA server via a unix socket file shared via a volume. Once connected to the server, user applications can consume the TAPA API via three different function: Open/Close/Watch. The proto file of the TAPA can be found [here](https://github.com/Nordix/Meridio/blob/master/api/ambassador/v1/tap.proto).

The watch function allows user applications to monitor the streams opened on the pod and check their status. 

### Open/Close handling

The open process takes place in 3 steps:
1. Connect to the trench if not already connected.
2. Connect to the conduit if not already connected.
3. Register to target registry if not already registered.

While a conduit is opened, the TAPA will monitor the VIP addresses in the trench via the NSP and update the connection to NSM by including the VIPs addresses in the IP Context. Thus, NSM will update the connection and add/remove IP addresses from the conduit target network interface.

The close process takes place in 3 steps:
1. Unregister itself from the NSP Target registry.
2. Close the conduit if no more stream opened in the conduit.
3. Disconnect from the trench (disconnect from NSP) if no more conduit opened.
If for some reason 

The only error the TAPA can return is to indicate to the client that the pod is already connected to another trench. Indeed, a pod cannot be connected to more than one trench at a time.

#### Registration

#### Refresh

While a stream is opened, the TAPA has to refresh its registration to the target registry to not be considered as a "ghost" entry and then to not be removed automatically.

To achieve the refresh, the TAPA will update its target with the same properties by calling the Register function regularly. After the call, the TAPA will check if the target is still in the `ENABLED` status for the target registry. If not, it means the target registry has previously removed the target and consider the last register call as a new entry, so it has overwritten the status to `DISABLED`. The TAPA will then start the registeration process a new time to register itself with a unique identifier.
