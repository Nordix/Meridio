## Description

In order to avoid IP collisions in the system and ensure a proper IPs distribution, this service is offering some IPAM functionalities that can be consumed using a kubernetes clusterIP service (over the kubernetes primary network). This IPAM Service is a [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) server listening on port 7777.

The specifications of the IPAM Service are written in a proto file accessible [here](https://github.com/Nordix/Meridio/blob/master/api/ipam/v1/ipam.proto).

### IP/Prefix distribution granularity

The Meridio IPAM distributes IP/Prefixes (always within the trench subnet defined in the configuration by `IPAM_PREFIX_IPV4` and `IPAM_PREFIX_IPV6`) at a few different levels. 

The first one is at the conduit level. Represented in blue (Conduit-A) and in red (Conduit-B) in the picture below, they are allocated automatically by the IPAM by watching the conduit list via the NSP service. The conduit subnet prefix lengths are defined in the configuration by `IPAM_CONDUIT_PREFIX_LENGTH_IPV4` and `IPAM_CONDUIT_PREFIX_LENGTH_IPV6`.

The second one is at the node level. Represented in black in the picture below (1 per node per conduit), they are allocated when the `Allocate` API function is called (note: there is currently no way to unallocate except if the conduit is removed.). The node subnet prefix lengths are defined in the configuration by `IPAM_NODE_PREFIX_LENGTH_IPV4` and `IPAM_NODE_PREFIX_LENGTH_IPV6`.

The third (last one) is at the pod level. Each pod will get assigned a unique IP address with `IPAM_NODE_PREFIX_LENGTH_IPV4` or `IPAM_NODE_PREFIX_LENGTH_IPV6` as prefix length.

* Target-1 is running on worker-A and connected to Conduit-A
* Target-2 is running on worker-A and connected to Conduit-B
* Target-3 is running on worker-B and connected to Conduit-A and Conduit-B
* Target-4 is running on worker-B and connected to Conduit-B

### Data persistence

Running as StatefulSet with a single replica, the IPAM handles restarts and pod deletions by saving the data in a local sqlite stored in a persistent volume requested via a volumeClaimTemplates.
